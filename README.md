# For the Trees
### Language: Odin

You play as the Sorax (He speaks for the Trees) But a corruption is encrouching, so you must take their knees!

Run around and kill corrupted forest spirits before they get to the Big Tree tm. Sometimes the corrupted leave a little bit of their old selves behind in the form of seed that restore health to the Big Tree tm.

There is no winning, just seeing how long you can go until the Big Tree tm is destroyed by the evils of ~~capitalism~~ corruption... Yeah, no metaphor here...
